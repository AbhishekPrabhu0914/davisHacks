    <h1>The Image Explosion</h1>

    <p>In today’s digital world, we are surrounded by images. From professionally curated libraries to spontaneous social media uploads, the volume of visual content is growing at a staggering pace.</p>

    <h2>A Visual Comparison</h2>

    <p>The graph below highlights the scale of this explosion. It compares different sources and platforms where images are stored, indexed, or uploaded.</p>

    <p>It’s fascinating to note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facebook</strong> leads by far, with over <strong>1.5 trillion</strong> images uploaded.</li>
        <li><strong>Pinterest</strong> follows with 240 billion pins saved — a haven for visual bookmarking.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Images</strong> indexes 136 billion images, helping users find visuals across the web.</li>
        <li><strong>Instagram</strong> users have contributed over 50 billion images, capturing moments across the globe.</li>
        <li>Even AI-generated images have reached a staggering 15 billion, showing the growing role of artificial creativity.</li>
        <li>And Shutterstock, despite being a professional stock library, holds a relatively modest 386 million images.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This graph paints a vivid picture of our image-saturated digital age. Platforms once meant for communication or search have now evolved into massive visual archives — and the numbers are only climbing.</p>
